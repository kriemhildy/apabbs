Anonymous Pre-Approval Bulletin Board System (APABBS)
-----------------------------------------------------

The general philosophy of this forum system is that moderation of posts after
they are published is a bad strategy. Trolls are usually content to get their
message heard even if it comes at the cost of their (temporary) ban.

Thus the only way to really allow anonymous conversation is to review every
single post prior to its publication. [Only this will ensure that the fullness
of the varied experience of the moderator will not go to waste.]

Installation
------------

1. install postgresql version 15+.
2. install rust using rustup.
3. install "pkg-config" via your package manager.
4. install rsync.
5. install sqlx-cli for postgres only:
   cargo install sqlx-cli --no-default-features --features native-tls,postgres
6. create a role with CREATEDB and LOGIN in postgresql.
7. install direnv and set it up to load .env files in your shell:
   https://dev.to/charlesloder/tidbit-get-direnv-to-use-env-5fkn
8. copy .env.example to .env and set the variables as needed.
9. run "sqlx database create" to create the database.
10. run "sqlx migrate run" to update the database schema to the current point.
11. configure a web server (e.g. nginx) to proxy to the app server.
    this is necessary for receiving assets (css and js). this server will also
    need to enable web socket upgrades and X-Real-IP forwarding.
12. run "cargo run" to start the app server on port 7878. alternatively set a
    "PORT" env var to run on a different port.
13. access the app via "localhost" in a browser.
14. DO NOT post on your own forum as the admin. ever.
